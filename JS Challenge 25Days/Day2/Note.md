### Map:
The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. 

Map objects are collections of key-value pairs. A key in the Map may only occur once; it is unique in the Map's collection. A Map object is iterated by key-value pairs â€” a for...of loop returns a 2-member array of [key, value] for each iteration.
**Note: Map() can only be constructed with new. Attempting to call it without new throws a TypeError.**
